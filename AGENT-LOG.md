- Added comprehensive unit tests for reporting, evacuation, unknown list initialization, and VEZHA client pagination to improve coverage.
- Declared missing dependencies (commons-lang3, mockito-inline) required by the codebase and tests.
- Documented the expanded test suite and execution notes in README.
- Removed mockito-inline dependency to rely on starter-managed Mockito versions and avoid resolution issues.
- Noted Mockito dependency guidance in README testing notes.
- Hardened `FaceApiRepository#getAllDetectionsInWindow` to stop using pages/total metadata and adjusted its test to prevent pagination hangs; documented the pagination guard in README.
- Refactored attendance, evacuation, and unknown person services for clearer helpers/constants, safer VEZHA/list handling, and tidier imports; updated README and ran the full Maven test suite.
- Added entrance timestamp support to evacuation statuses and reports (DB schema add, service updates, Excel column), plus refreshed tests/README.
- Ensured evacuation status refresh paginates through all list items (fixing >1000 person lists) and added a unit test to cover pagination.
- Normalized VEZHA API URL construction in `FaceApiRepository` to handle trailing base-url slashes, added a regression test for detections, and documented the fix.
- Updated `FaceApiRepository` to include an empty `image` part in multipart detection requests, added a regression check to ensure the body carries the part, and documented the behavior in README.
- Set a non-blank filename on the empty multipart `image` field for detection requests to satisfy VEZHA validation and tightened the regression test and README note accordingly.
- Added `min_detection_similarity` support to detections calls (defaulting to 0), wired the property into `VezhaApiProps`, updated the config example/README, and extended the detection URL test; ran `./mvnw -B -Dtest=FaceApiRepositoryTest test`.
- Improved VEZHA detection error handling to surface HTTP status/response text in exceptions, added a regression test for the failure path, and documented the logging behavior.
- Send an empty multipart body (no image part) for detection filters to mirror the browser request and avoid VEZHA “image processing failed” responses; adjusted tests/README accordingly.
- Added search-by-photo deduplication when adding unknown persons: download detection image, POST to `/face/list_items/search_by_photo` (multipart, confidence=90), only create list item when VEZHA returns an empty array; guarded errors/invalid images by skipping additions; documented the flow and covered it with repository tests.
- Tuned search-by-photo error logging to output the HTTP status/response summary instead of a full stack trace and documented the change in the README.
- Softened logging on expected failure paths in `FaceApiRepository` and `EvacuationStatusService` so tests no longer emit stack traces while still surfacing the error summaries; recorded the quieter logging in the README.
- Fixed Telegram evacuation workbook ingestion to read list item IDs from the correct column and covered the parser with a regression unit test.
- Made PostgreSQL configuration parsing more tolerant (safe port fallback) and ensured evacuation report generation fails fast when status queries fail to avoid empty reports; updated README.
- Guarded unknown list startup initialization so VEZHA content-type errors no longer crash the application; documented the behavior in README.

- Fixed `FaceApiRepository#getAllDetectionsInWindow` to paginate until an empty/partial page regardless of VEZHA total/pages metadata, updated its unit test, and refreshed README guidance.
- Updated detection pagination test to expect the follow-up empty page request and noted the pagination test behavior in README.
- Rewrote the deprecated VEZHA customization spec to align with current implementation (evacuation, cafeteria attendance, unknown list flows) in TECHNICAL-SPEC.md and linked it from README.
