- Added comprehensive unit tests for reporting, evacuation, unknown list initialization, and VEZHA client pagination to improve coverage.
- Declared missing dependencies (commons-lang3, mockito-inline) required by the codebase and tests.
- Documented the expanded test suite and execution notes in README.
- Removed mockito-inline dependency to rely on starter-managed Mockito versions and avoid resolution issues.
- Noted Mockito dependency guidance in README testing notes.
- Hardened `FaceApiRepository#getAllDetectionsInWindow` to stop using pages/total metadata and adjusted its test to prevent pagination hangs; documented the pagination guard in README.
- Refactored attendance, evacuation, and unknown person services for clearer helpers/constants, safer VEZHA/list handling, and tidier imports; updated README and ran the full Maven test suite.
