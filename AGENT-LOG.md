- Added comprehensive unit tests for reporting, evacuation, unknown list initialization, and VEZHA client pagination to improve coverage.
- Declared missing dependencies (commons-lang3, mockito-inline) required by the codebase and tests.
- Documented the expanded test suite and execution notes in README.
- Removed mockito-inline dependency to rely on starter-managed Mockito versions and avoid resolution issues.
- Noted Mockito dependency guidance in README testing notes.
- Hardened `FaceApiRepository#getAllDetectionsInWindow` to stop using pages/total metadata and adjusted its test to prevent pagination hangs; documented the pagination guard in README.
- Refactored attendance, evacuation, and unknown person services for clearer helpers/constants, safer VEZHA/list handling, and tidier imports; updated README and ran the full Maven test suite.
- Added entrance timestamp support to evacuation statuses and reports (DB schema add, service updates, Excel column), plus refreshed tests/README.
- Ensured evacuation status refresh paginates through all list items (fixing >1000 person lists) and added a unit test to cover pagination.
- Normalized VEZHA API URL construction in `FaceApiRepository` to handle trailing base-url slashes, added a regression test for detections, and documented the fix.
- Updated `FaceApiRepository` to include an empty `image` part in multipart detection requests, added a regression check to ensure the body carries the part, and documented the behavior in README.
- Set a non-blank filename on the empty multipart `image` field for detection requests to satisfy VEZHA validation and tightened the regression test and README note accordingly.
- Added `min_detection_similarity` support to detections calls (defaulting to 0), wired the property into `VezhaApiProps`, updated the config example/README, and extended the detection URL test; ran `./mvnw -B -Dtest=FaceApiRepositoryTest test`.
- Improved VEZHA detection error handling to surface HTTP status/response text in exceptions, added a regression test for the failure path, and documented the logging behavior.
- Send a 1x1 PNG placeholder (with filename/content-type) in detection requests to prevent VEZHA from returning “image processing failed” when filtering without an uploaded photo; adjusted tests/README accordingly.
